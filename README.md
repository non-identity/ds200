# DS200 Module 4 Assignment

This repository contains code, data and plots for assignment given as a part of  module 4 of [DS 200: Research Methods](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/academics/ds200/) course.

## Datasets

- DATASET1 : [All India Crowdsourced Mobile Data Speed Measurement for July 2019](https://data.gov.in/resources/all-india-crowdsourced-mobile-data-speed-measurement-july-2019) (Reference - [Link](https://myspeed.trai.gov.in/))
- DATASET2 : [Monthly Traffic and Operating Statistics of Indian Carriers on Non-Scheduled Domestic Services during 2017](https://data.gov.in/resources/monthly-traffic-and-operating-statistics-indian-carriers-non-scheduled-domestic-services-0) (Reference - [Link](http://dgca.nic.in/reports/stat-ind.htm))

## Plots

### Scatter Plot (using DATASET2)

There's obviously a correlation between total hours flown by flights and the distance they covered as the average speed of flights can be expected to remain approximately the same over different months. This is just a demonstration of how scatter plots can be used to show correlation.

### Box Plot (using DATASET1)

The median download speed is more or less the same for all the providers, but Jio considerably outperforms the other providers in the third quartile.

### Bar Chart (using DATASET2)

One interesting thing to note here is the fact that Airtel has the highest average download speed in 4G but the least average download speed in 3G.
